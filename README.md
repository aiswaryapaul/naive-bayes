# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction using Naive Bayes

This project is a hands-on implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict the presence of heart disease using a publicly available dataset. It demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow including data loading, preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type (4 values)
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca`: Number of major vessels (0–3)
- `thal`: Thalassemia
- `target`: 1 = heart disease present, 0 = not present

## 📊 Model Used

**Naive Bayes Classifier (GaussianNB)**

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem assuming independence between predictors. It's efficient and performs well with high-dimensional data.

---

## ✅ Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)**

---

## 📌 Results

The model shows a reasonably good performance in predicting heart disease based on the given attributes, demonstrating the effectiveness of Naive Bayes in classification problems.
